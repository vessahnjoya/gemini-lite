Welcome my friend, this was written by a human being not by some AI. Why do they even care about AI
Why did they create AI? Yes it is useful for vide games (damn imagine the neural networks used to train AI to play FIFA on legendary mode)
You see that sounds crazy, it is but by 2027 it should not be new to you!
I HATE AI, every time i use it it ends badly, failing of courses when using it to learn!
I am used to traditional teaching, the teacher comes present the topic of the day, engages in communication, then dictates some notes or have the school print it and distributes it to students
It sounds and is better than having a teacher come and read slides and we students have to create our own notesI mkean its also nicer but so far does not work with me
I wish for math courses we had lots of TAs and even lecturers there as TAs and have some real interactive solvinbg i.e going to a board (chalk etc) then solving questions
Damn i really miss high school, was so fun, maths, further maths. Mechanics, differential equations, vectors, sequences and series, comple numbers, group theory.
Ah man and the chemistry and physics labs, having to preapre standar solutions, almost had an accident when diluting concentrated HCL
placing the clamp and stand, adjusting the burettes, pipetting 25cm^3 of solution, putting into beaker, WATCH OUT WHEN USING A PIPETTE, slow breaths and avoid doing it fast else solutions ends up in your stomach
In such cases be fast a let your lecturer know so he quickly provides a neutralising solutions else BYE BYE MY friend
